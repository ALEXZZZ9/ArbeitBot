# Arbeit Bot
This is the source code of [@arbeit_bot](https://telegram.me/arbeit_bot) ‚Äì first Telegram-based open source freelance market.

# Want to contribute?
ArbeitBot is a completely non-profit and community-driven project which really depends on it's contributors.

The best option to add a feature to the codebase is to first [open an issue](https://github.com/ArbeitBot/ArbeitBot/issues) with label `Enhancement` (to notify us that you are working on something) where you may also communicate with initial contributors, then fork this project and create a pull request.

If you want to fix a bug from [the list of the issues](https://github.com/ArbeitBot/ArbeitBot/issues), please comment under the issue that you are working on it, then fork the repository and create a pull request.

Please use [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as the main tool to follow our project-wide codestyle.

We highly appreciate any help and that's why the most active contributors will get a üêù emoji beside their freelancer profile to stand out among other freelancers of the same category, like that:

### Necessary environment variables
* `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` ‚Äì api key for your telegram bot
* `MONGO_DB_URL` ‚Äì url of your mongo database
* `ARBEIT_BOT_STAGING_URL` ‚Äì url of your staging server for flightplan
* `ARBEIT_BOT_PRODUCTION_URL` ‚Äì url of your production server for flightplan
* `ARBEIT_BOT_PRODUCTION_URL` ‚Äì url of your production server for flightplan
* *(Optional)* `USE_WEBHOOKS` ‚Äì flag identifying if bot should use webhooks or should fetch updates every 1000 seconds, `false` if isn't set
* *(Optional)* `WEBHOOK_CALLBACK_URL` ‚Äì url that should be used by Telegram servers for webhooks, should be `https`
* *(Optional)* `SSL_CERTIFICATE_PATH` ‚Äì path to ssl certificate
* *(Optional)* `SSH_RSA_PATH` ‚Äì path to ssh private certificate (should not be password encrypted)

### How to get ssl certificate and key
You can use this command on server to create self-signed ssl key that can be accepted by Telegram servers:

`openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout key.key -x509 -days 365 -out crt.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Brooklyn/O=Arbeit_bot/CN={DOMAIN}"`

After execution you will have `key.key` (your ssl key) and `crt.pem` (your ssl certificate).

**Important:** please make sure to add your real server address instead of `{DOMAIN}` in this command. If you aren't using domain name, you can leave your IP there in the form of `1.1.1.1`. If you don't specify the correct address or domain here, you will not be able to receive any updates from Telegram servers.
